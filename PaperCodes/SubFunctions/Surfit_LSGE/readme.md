Note of the toolbox :   
*The Least Squares Geometric Elements library consits of MatLab functions to find the least-squares fit of geometric shapes to data, implementing a number of the geometric fitting routines key functions. It is based on a general purpose non-linear least-squares solver that takes as input function-and-gradient routines, and these routines are implementations of the geometric evaluation key functions. LSGE was developed by NPL Centre for Mathematics and Scientific Computing.*
